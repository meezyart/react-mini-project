#FRONT-END MINI-PROJECT

##What do I need to do?
-----------

Please build a simple website based on the image and json provided. The point of this mini-project is to get an idea of how you approach html/css/js. Go ahead and slice the images from the png. The content is in the included json file. Use any client-side js library you prefer to parse and display the data.


##Basic Requirements
-----------

-Use the included json file to build out the page.
—Each ‘track’ should have its own tab.
-The session titles make up the tabs on the left.

## Installation

1. Run `yarn install` in the directory
